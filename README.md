👋 Hi, I'm monta-gh  
I'm a freelance AI enthusiast with nearly 20 years of experience in localization and multilingual translation QA, backed by a degree from a U.S. university.  
I build AI-powered tools that combine Python, OpenAI API, and vector search (RAG) to improve language workflows and explore real-world applications.
