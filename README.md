I'm monta-gh  
I'm a freelance AI enthusiast with nearly 20 years of experience in localization and multilingual translation QA, backed by a U.S. university degree.
Though not a full-stack engineer, I’ve created working AI tools that solve real problems—proof that curiosity and persistence can go a long way.
In 2024, I developed and deployed an AI-powered translation QA tool using Power Automate and Azure OpenAI—without prior experience with these tools—and reduced the manual QA workload by over 70% in real-world localization projects.
That experience marked the beginning of my journey into prompt engineering and generative AI. Since then, I've been focusing on building tools that apply structured prompts to solve practical problems in language quality evaluation and information retrieval.
