I'm monta-gh  
I'm a freelance AI enthusiast with nearly 20 years of experience in localization and multilingual translation QA, backed by a U.S. university degree.
Though not a full-stack engineer, I’ve created working AI tools that solve real problems—proof that curiosity and persistence can go a long way.
In 2024, I developed and deployed an AI-powered translation QA tool using Power Automate and Azure OpenAI—without prior experience with these tools—reducing QA workload by over 50% in actual localization projects.
That experience marked the beginning of my journey with generative AI, and since then I've built several personal projects to explore its real-world applications.
